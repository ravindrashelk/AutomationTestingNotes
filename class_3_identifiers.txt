Identifiers:-
-----------

A name in python program is called identifier.
It can be (class name,function name, module name and variable name).

what is variable ?

ans:- variable is a storage area, where we can store our data, it's also provide us data's data type.

ex:-
variable_name = data


Rules to define identifiers in python:-
---------------------------------------
1.The only allowed charcters in python are:-
	
	> alphabet symbols(upper case and lower case).
	> digits(0 to 9)
	> Underscore symbol(_), No other special Char

2.Identifiers should not start with the digits.

Ex:-	
	>>> cuttack1 = "silver city"
>>> print(cuttack1)
silver city
>>> 1cuttack = "silver city"
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> 


3.Indentifiers are case sensitive, of course python language is case sensitive language.

Ex:- 
> >>> result = 100
>>> Result = 90
>>> 
>>> RESULT
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#10>", line 1, in <module>
    RESULT
NameError: name 'RESULT' is not defined
>>> result
100
>>> Result
90
>>> 

4.There is no length limit for python identifiers,But not recommended to use too length identifiers.


Casing:-
-------

Camel Casing:- Folder name,Class Name, Module Name
------------

Fisrt Char. of the word is always upper case, No space between the words and no special are used here.

Ex:- 

StateBankOfIndia123



Snkae Casing:-File name,Variable name and function name
-------------

Upper case is not used in snake casing, and underscore(_) used in between the words.

Ex:- 
state_bank_of_india

x = 10 (Normal Variable)

_x = 10 (procted variable)

__x = 10 (Private Variable)
