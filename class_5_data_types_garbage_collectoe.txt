                                           Data Types:-


Data Type represent the type of data present inside a variable
In Python we are not required to specify the type explicily, Because python is a dynamically typed laguage.

variable = data

There are in 14 types od data avialable in Python(Inbuit Data types)

Name         Use in Python
----         
1.Integer :- int()
2.Float   :- float()
3.Complex :- complex()
4.Boolean :- bool()
5.String   :- str()
6.List     :- list()
7.Tuple   :- tuple()
8.Set     :- set()
9.Frozenset :- frozensset()
10.Bytes     :- bytes()
11.Bytearray  :- bytearray()
12.Range      :- range()
13.Dictionary  :- dict()
14.None        :- None


Variable and Data:-
-----------
Data is fixed in python, and have a specific location. We create varibale and store data in varibale. 
So that variable indicate data's location , so that data's location and variable's loaction is same.

Ex:-
>>> id(10)
2747102816848
>>> a = 10
>>> id(a)
2747102816848
>>> a = 20
>>> id(a)
2747102817168
>>> 


Garbage Collection:-
------------------
In Old lanuages like C++,Java programmer is responsible for unnessary object destruction. 
Usally programmer taking very much time while destructing object and mine while it's creating issues,
 If any neglectance , total memory can be filled with useless object which creates meomory problems.

In python, We have some assitance which is always running in the backgound to destroy useless object. 
Because this assitance the chance of falling python program with memory problems is very less.
 This assiatant is nothing but Garbage Collector.

It's always delets old same variable objects,Hence the main object of Garbage collector is to destroy useless objects.
